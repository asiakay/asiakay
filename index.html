<li><p>👩🏿‍💻 In 2020, I started my GitHub for keeping track of projects related to Software Engineering with C#. In the process of documenting the technical progress I was starting to make when in regards to software engineering, I became passionate about the best practices for developing projects from the User Experience. Going down this road gave me a word for the impact I had always wanted to achive through learning audio engineering. That word was design thinking. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For me, the most satisfying element of engineering with software is the opportunity to be creative while having the challenge of working within a structured framework. Ultimately, I&#39;m experiencing it as another way to elevate the audience&#39;s mood by bringing ideas that solve problems to life. </p>
</li>
<li><p>🌱 I&#39;m proud of the fact that my tech stack knowledege base has expanded to include <strong>C#, .NET, JavaScript, Node.JS, React, Express, Gatsby, GraphQL and Figma</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>🔭 Further, I&#39;ve been exploring Cloud technologies with deployments to <strong>Azure, AWS, Heroku, Vercel, &amp; Google Cloud</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>🥳 At the moment, I’m working on freelance and Open source projects while integrating <strong>MongoDB, Docker, Reach &amp; Solidity, CI/CD &amp; Kubernetes</strong> into my work flow.</p>
