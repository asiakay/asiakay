# Hey, I’m Asia K.

I got into coding because I wanted to secure my future. Now I use it to build tools that help people solve real problems, communicate clearly, and create more freedom in their work and communities.

I believe technology should empower people — not overwhelm them or leave them out. If the product is **liberation** and the service is **empowerment**, then the goal is simple: build things that actually help.

### What I Do

- Build human-centered systems
- Translate complex ideas into simple tools
- Use tech for clarity, not confusion
