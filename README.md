### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my Github Page! Thanks for taking the time to explore!

- 👩🏿‍💻 In 2020, I started documenting my technical progress towards becoming a UI/UX focused Software Engineer during a 10 week bootcamp.
- 🌱 Thanks to the a new computer, time, & internet access, growing a tech stack (**C#,.NET, Node.JS, React, Next, Express**) became possible.

- 🥳 At the moment, I’m excited to start contributing to **Open Source** projects while implementing **Figma, MongoDB, Docker, Reach, & Solidity, GraphQL, & Kubernetes** into my work flow.
