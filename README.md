I design human-centered systems and stories that address real problems by connecting creativity, technology, and advocacy. I simplify complex ideas, amplify unheard voices, and build solutions that inspire equity, innovation, and impact.



[Produce PLU Code Search](https://github.com/asiakay/Produce-PLU-Code-Search): Grocery store employees often waste time and make errors searching for produce PLU codes. This app streamlines the process, improving efficiency and accuracy.


[BlackHistoryFacts](https://github.com/asiakay/history-fact-app): There's a significant gap in accessible, accurate information about the positive contributions of historically marginalized groups. This project challenges systemic racism and misinformation.

Florists face manual, error-prone inventory management. Floral Flow provides a digital, real-time solution for streamlined inventory control and secure access



[Repair Tracker Pro](https://github.com/asiakay/repair-tracker-pro): Retail stores struggle with manual tracking and communication gaps in repair management. This app offers centralized tracking, real-time notifications, and visual dashboards to enhance efficiency.
