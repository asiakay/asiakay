- 👩🏿‍💻 In 2020, I started my GitHub for keeping track of projects related to Software Engineering with C#. In the process of documenting the technical progress I was starting to make when in regards to software engineering, I became passionate about the best practices for developing projects from the User Experience. Going down this road gave me a word for the impact I had always wanted to achive through learning audio engineering. That word was design thinking. 

- For me, the most satisfying element of engineering with software is the opportunity to be creative while having the challenge of working within a structured framework. Ultimately, I'm experiencing it as another way to elevate the audience's mood by bringing ideas that solve problems to life. 

- 🌱 I'm proud of the fact that my tech stack knowledege base has expanded to include **C#, .NET, JavaScript, Node.JS, React, Express, Gatsby, GraphQL and Figma**

- 🔭 Further, I've been exploring Cloud technologies with deployments to **Azure, AWS, Heroku, Vercel, & Google Cloud**.
 
- 🥳 At the moment, I’m working on freelance and Open source projects while integrating **MongoDB, Docker, Reach & Solidity, CI/CD & Kubernetes** into my work flow.
