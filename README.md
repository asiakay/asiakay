##### 👩🏿‍💻 In 2020, I attended a nine-week software engineering bootcamp to learn software engineering. ##### 

Through Zoom lectures, the instructor guided us on: 

[x] How to create a GitHub account and why it is essential to have one. 

*After creating the GitHub account, we learned the benefits of Git. It provides developers the ability to push and pull code to and from a single source. This prevents code from being accidentally overwritten. And it allows remote teams to work on new features without fear of breaking the enitre application.*

##### Other concepts the course introduced:  #####

[x] How to access the command line interface, or CLI (The black screen with the white letters you see in the movies 🍿). As well as, how to install software and third party middlewares at the CLI to plug into our applications.  
[x] How to create types of variables and why do we use them in programming? 
[x] How to call methods and why do we use them in programming? 
[x] How to use operands, ternary operators, if-else statememts to design application logic?  

##### GitHub functions and basic Git commands including: #####

[x] how to make sure that Git tracks your contributions to the main repository 
[x] how to initialize a local repository to define the starting point for recording changes to the code
[x] how to fork and clone/copy repositories, or archives of code 
[x] how to add new and/or changed files to the staging area 
[x] how to save the changes in the local repository after files have been added to the staging area 
[x] how to send the saved local changes to the main branch of a repository 
[x] how to check which files were saved to the staging area and which files were not 
[x] how to view, add, and delete remote connections to and from other remote repositories 
[x] how to do CRUD operations on branches
[x] how to capture changes from a remote server and merge the changes to the local repository directory
[x] how to view any conflicts from merging version histories across local repositories, compare them and preview before committing
